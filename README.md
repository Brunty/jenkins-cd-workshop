See the `GETTING-STARTED.md` file for information on how to get up and running with this repo for the workshop.

See the `USEFUL-LINKS.md` file for a series of resources and links that will prove useful before/during/after the workshop.

Note: looking back, the wording of the abstract of the workshop leans more towards Continuous Integration - that'll be a part of it at the start, but the main focus will be delivery pipelines in Jenkins via the pipeline plugin and a Jenkinsfile.
